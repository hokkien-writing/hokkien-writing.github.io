## PREFACE.

The compilation of this Dictionary, which contains 5442 words, has occupied four years, in connection with much other work. Thanks are due from the author to many who have incidentally assisted her in the making of this book, especially to Dr. S. Wells Williams, whose far greater labors have helped her to such knowledge as she has of the Chinese language; to Dr. Wm. Ashmore, whose acquaintance with the Swatow vernacular has made his advice valuable to her; to those who at different times and places have cared for her during severe illness; to those who have furnished the funds for the publication of her work; and to Dr. and Mrs. M. T. Yates, of Shanghai, whose home has been hers during the year of putting the book through the press.
A. M. FIELDE.
