## Lesson X. Grammar.

Substantives and Adjectives are not declined: the same word expresses both the singular and the plural. Pronouns hove a plural form.

| Singular               | Plural                              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 【我】 (Uá) I.           | 【阮。咱】(Ún or nán) we.                |
| 【爾】(Lṳ́) thou or you. | 【恁】(Nín) ye or you.                 |
| 【伊】(I) he, she, it.   | 【因。伊人】 (In or i--nâng) they, them. |

The distinctions of moods, tenses, numbers and persons are shown by the addition of certain auxiliary verbs or particles, as follows:—

### indicative mood.

#### present tense.

* 【我來】(Uá lâi) I come.
* 【爾去】(Lṳ́ khṳ̀) You go.
* 【伊要】(I àiⁿ) He wants.
* 【阮勿】(Ún màiⁿ) We don't want.
* 【恁是我個朋友】(Nín sĩ uá kâi phêng-iú) You are my friends.
* 【因。伊人是外人】(In or i--nâng sĩ gūa-nâng) They are outsiders.

#### past tense.

The common signs of the Past Tense are 有 ũ and 甞 chêng, and are employed chiefly in asking questions and in giving answers, but seldom when a subject is simply being spoken of, viz.—

* 【伊分我】(I pun uá) He gave me.
* 【伊昨日來】(I tsa-jít lâi) He came yesterday.
* 【伊昨日有來或無】(I tsa-jít ũ lâi a-bô?) Did he come yesterday or not?

* 【我昨日甞來。我昨日有來】(Uá tsa-jít chêng--lâi, or uá tsa-jít ũ--lâi) I did come yesterday.

#### perfect tense.

The chief signs of the Perfect Tense are 了 lióu, 正 chiàⁿ, 識 pat, 有 ũ, 未 būe, and 亞未 a-būe.

Lióu[1] 了 (finish) can only be used to subjects being spoken of, and cannot be used in asking questions, viz.—

* 【伊來了】(I lâi--lō) He has come.
* 【阮知了】(Ún tsai--lō) We have known.
* 【因到了】(In kàu--lō) They have arrived.

Chiàⁿ 正 (just) and 識 pat (ever) can be used both to questions and answers, viz.—

* 【伊正來】(I chiàⁿ-lâi) He has just come.
* 【爾此時正來】(Lṳ́ chi-tsûn chìaⁿ-lâi?) Have you just now come?
* 【爾昔識來此處否】(Lṳ́ tsá pat-lâi--chié mē?) Have you ever been here before?
* 【我昔不識來此處】(Uá tsá m̄-pat lâi--chié) I have never been here before.

Ũ (have) 有 in the Perfect Tense, generally followed by the interrogative sign 亞未 a-būe, is used for questions only, and 未 būe (not yet) is used for answers, viz.—

* 【伊有來或未】(I ũ[2] lâi a-būe?) Has he come?
* 【伊未來】(I būe lâi) He has not come.
* 【因有去或未】(In ũ[2] khṳ̀ a-būe?) Have they gone?
* 【因未去】(In būe khṳ̀) They have not gone.

#### future tense.

The chief signs of the Future Tense are àiⁿ, 正要 chiàⁿ-àiⁿ, (want) 會 õi (can) and 袂 bõi (cannot.) viz.—

### potential mood.

The signs of the Potential Mood are 會 õi, 袂 bõi, 會得 õi-tit, 袂得 bõi-tit, 好 hó, 着 tiéh, and 不可 m̄-móⁿ.

Õi (can) 會 implies ability, and 袂 bõi (cannot) implies its opposite, inability.

------

[1] This word is so unaccented, that it is always sounded lō instead of lióu, when it comes after a Double hyphen.
[2] In every case ũ may be omitted if preferred.
[3] Chiàⁿ-àiⁿ is nearly the same as the auxillary verb will, and is employed thus, e. g. I tiang-sî chiàⁿ-àiⁿ lâi? when will he come? that is to say, he is not coming now, but when will he come? and the answer is I khiã-tiām chiàⁿ-àiⁿ lâi, He will come bye and bye, that is to say, he will come, but not before the time when he intends to come.
